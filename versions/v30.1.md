## comments about the image

- nothing special

## flags and parameters

### starting the daemon

```bash
bash-4.4$ bitcoind -?
Bitcoin Core daemon version v30.1.0 bitcoind

The Bitcoin Core daemon (bitcoind) is a headless program that connects to the Bitcoin network to validate and relay transactions and blocks, as well as relaying addresses.

It provides the backbone of the Bitcoin network and its RPC, REST and ZMQ services can provide various transaction, block and address-related services.

There is an optional wallet component which provides transaction services.

It can be used in a headless environment or as part of a server setup.

Usage: bitcoind [options]

Options:

  -alertnotify=<cmd>
       Execute command when an alert is raised (%s in cmd is replaced by
       message)

  -allowignoredconf
       For backwards compatibility, treat an unused bitcoin.conf file in the
       datadir as a warning, not an error.

  -assumevalid=<hex>
       If this block is in the chain assume that it and its ancestors are valid
       and potentially skip their script verification (0 to verify all,
       default:
       00000000000000000000611fd22f2df7c8fbd0688745c3a6c3bb5109cc2a12cb,
       testnet3:
       0000000000000065c6c38258e201971a3fdfcc2ceee0dd6e85a6c022d45dee34,
       testnet4:
       000000000000000180a58e7fa3b0db84b5ea76377524894f53660d93ac839d9b,
       signet:
       000000128586e26813922680309f04e1de713c7542fee86ed908f56368aefe2e)

  -blockfilterindex=<type>
       Maintain an index of compact filters by block (default: 0, values:
       basic). If <type> is not supplied or if <type> = 1, indexes for
       all known types are enabled.

  -blocknotify=<cmd>
       Execute command when the best block changes (%s in cmd is replaced by
       block hash)

  -blockreconstructionextratxn=<n>
       Extra transactions to keep in memory for compact block reconstructions
       (default: 100)

  -blocksdir=<dir>
       Specify directory to hold blocks subdirectory for *.dat files (default:
       <datadir>)

  -blocksonly
       Whether to reject transactions from network peers. Disables automatic
       broadcast and rebroadcast of transactions, unless the source peer
       has the 'forcerelay' permission. RPC transactions are not
       affected. (default: 0)

  -blocksxor
       Whether an XOR-key applies to blocksdir *.dat files. The created XOR-key
       will be zeros for an existing blocksdir or when `-blocksxor=0` is
       set, and random for a freshly initialized blocksdir. (default: 1)

  -coinstatsindex
       Maintain coinstats index used by the gettxoutsetinfo RPC (default: 0)

  -conf=<file>
       Specify path to read-only configuration file. Relative paths will be
       prefixed by datadir location (only useable from command line, not
       configuration file) (default: bitcoin.conf)

  -daemon
       Run in the background as a daemon and accept commands (default: 0)

  -daemonwait
       Wait for initialization to be finished before exiting. This implies
       -daemon (default: 0)

  -datadir=<dir>
       Specify data directory

  -dbcache=<n>
       Maximum database cache size <n> MiB (minimum 4, default: 450). Make sure
       you have enough RAM. In addition, unused memory allocated to the
       mempool is shared with this cache (see -maxmempool).

  -debuglogfile=<file>
       Specify location of debug log file (default: debug.log). Relative paths
       will be prefixed by a net-specific datadir location. Pass
       -nodebuglogfile to disable writing the log to a file.

  -help
       Print this help message and exit (also -h or -?)

  -includeconf=<file>
       Specify additional configuration file, relative to the -datadir path
       (only useable from configuration file, not command line)

  -loadblock=<file>
       Imports blocks from external file on startup

  -maxmempool=<n>
       Keep the transaction memory pool below <n> megabytes (default: 300)

  -maxorphantx=<n>
       (Removed option, see release notes)

  -mempoolexpiry=<n>
       Do not keep transactions in the mempool longer than <n> hours (default:
       336)

  -par=<n>
       Set the number of script verification threads (0 = auto, up to 15, <0 =
       leave that many cores free, default: 0)

  -persistmempool
       Whether to save the mempool on shutdown and load on restart (default: 1)

  -persistmempoolv1
       Whether a mempool.dat file created by -persistmempool or the savemempool
       RPC will be written in the legacy format (version 1) or the
       current format (version 2). This temporary option will be removed
       in the future. (default: 0)

  -pid=<file>
       Specify pid file. Relative paths will be prefixed by a net-specific
       datadir location. (default: bitcoind.pid)

  -prune=<n>
       Reduce storage requirements by enabling pruning (deleting) of old
       blocks. This allows the pruneblockchain RPC to be called to
       delete specific blocks and enables automatic pruning of old
       blocks if a target size in MiB is provided. This mode is
       incompatible with -txindex. Warning: Reverting this setting
       requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 =
       disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC, >=550 =
       automatically prune block files to stay under the specified
       target size in MiB)

  -reindex
       If enabled, wipe chain state and block index, and rebuild them from
       blk*.dat files on disk. Also wipe and rebuild other optional
       indexes that are active. If an assumeutxo snapshot was loaded,
       its chainstate will be wiped as well. The snapshot can then be
       reloaded via RPC.

  -reindex-chainstate
       If enabled, wipe chain state, and rebuild it from blk*.dat files on
       disk. If an assumeutxo snapshot was loaded, its chainstate will
       be wiped as well. The snapshot can then be reloaded via RPC.

  -settings=<file>
       Specify path to dynamic settings data file. Can be disabled with
       -nosettings. File is written at runtime and not meant to be
       edited by users (use bitcoin.conf instead for custom settings).
       Relative paths will be prefixed by datadir location. (default:
       settings.json)

  -shutdownnotify=<cmd>
       Execute command immediately before beginning shutdown. The need for
       shutdown may be urgent, so be careful not to delay it long (if
       the command doesn't require interaction with the server, consider
       having it fork into the background).

  -startupnotify=<cmd>
       Execute command on startup.

  -txindex
       Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc
       call (default: 0)

  -version
       Print version and exit

Connection options:

  -addnode=<ip>
       Add a node to connect to and attempt to keep the connection open (see
       the addnode RPC help for more info). This option can be specified
       multiple times to add multiple nodes; connections are limited to
       8 at a time and are counted separately from the -maxconnections
       limit.

  -asmap=<file>
       Specify asn mapping used for bucketing of the peers (default:
       ip_asn.map). Relative paths will be prefixed by the net-specific
       datadir location.

  -bantime=<n>
       Default duration (in seconds) of manually configured bans (default:
       86400)

  -bind=<addr>[:<port>][=onion]
       Bind to given address and always listen on it (default: 0.0.0.0). Use
       [host]:port notation for IPv6. Append =onion to tag any incoming
       connections to that address and port as incoming Tor connections
       (default: 127.0.0.1:8334=onion, testnet3: 127.0.0.1:18334=onion,
       testnet4: 127.0.0.1:48334=onion, signet: 127.0.0.1:38334=onion,
       regtest: 127.0.0.1:18445=onion)

  -cjdnsreachable
       If set, then this host is configured for CJDNS (connecting to fc00::/8
       addresses would lead us to the CJDNS network, see doc/cjdns.md)
       (default: 0)

  -connect=<ip>
       Connect only to the specified node; -noconnect disables automatic
       connections (the rules for this peer are the same as for
       -addnode). This option can be specified multiple times to connect
       to multiple nodes.

  -discover
       Discover own IP addresses (default: 1 when listening and no -externalip
       or -proxy)

  -dns
       Allow DNS lookups for -addnode, -seednode and -connect (default: 1)

  -dnsseed
       Query for peer addresses via DNS lookup, if low on addresses (default: 1
       unless -connect used or -maxconnections=0)

  -externalip=<ip>
       Specify your own public address

  -fixedseeds
       Allow fixed seeds if DNS seeds don't provide peers (default: 1)

  -forcednsseed
       Always query for peer addresses via DNS lookup (default: 0)

  -i2pacceptincoming
       Whether to accept inbound I2P connections (default: 1). Ignored if
       -i2psam is not set. Listening for inbound I2P connections is done
       through the SAM proxy, not by binding to a local address and
       port.

  -i2psam=<ip:port>
       I2P SAM proxy to reach I2P peers and accept I2P connections (default:
       none)

  -listen
       Accept connections from outside (default: 1 if no -proxy, -connect or
       -maxconnections=0)

  -listenonion
       Automatically create Tor onion service (default: 1)

  -maxconnections=<n>
       Maintain at most <n> automatic connections to peers (default: 125). This
       limit does not apply to connections manually added via -addnode
       or the addnode RPC, which have a separate limit of 8.

  -maxreceivebuffer=<n>
       Maximum per-connection receive buffer, <n>*1000 bytes (default: 5000)

  -maxsendbuffer=<n>
       Maximum per-connection memory usage for the send buffer, <n>*1000 bytes
       (default: 1000)

  -maxuploadtarget=<n>
       Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target per 24h. Limit
       does not apply to peers with 'download' permission or blocks
       created within past week. 0 = no limit (default: 0M). Optional
       suffix units [k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T] (default: M). Lowercase is 1000
       base while uppercase is 1024 base

  -natpmp
       Use PCP or NAT-PMP to map the listening port (default: 1)

  -networkactive
       Enable all P2P network activity (default: 1). Can be changed by the
       setnetworkactive RPC command

  -onion=<ip:port|path>
       Use separate SOCKS5 proxy to reach peers via Tor onion services, set
       -noonion to disable (default: -proxy). May be a local file path
       prefixed with 'unix:'.

  -onlynet=<net>
       Make automatic outbound connections only to network <net> (ipv4, ipv6,
       onion, i2p, cjdns). Inbound and manual connections are not
       affected by this option. It can be specified multiple times to
       allow multiple networks.

  -peerblockfilters
       Serve compact block filters to peers per BIP 157 (default: 0)

  -peerbloomfilters
       Support filtering of blocks and transaction with bloom filters (default:
       0)

  -port=<port>
       Listen for connections on <port> (default: 8333, testnet3: 18333,
       testnet4: 48333, signet: 38333, regtest: 18444). Not relevant for
       I2P (see doc/i2p.md). If set to a value x, the default onion
       listening port will be set to x+1.

  -proxy=<ip>[:<port>]|unix:<path>[=<network>]
       Connect through SOCKS5 proxy, set -noproxy to disable. May be a local
       file path prefixed with 'unix:' if the proxy supports it. Could
       end in =network to set the proxy only for that network. The
       network can be any of ipv4, ipv6, tor or cjdns. (default:
       disabled)

  -proxyrandomize
       Randomize credentials for every proxy connection. This enables Tor
       stream isolation (default: 1)

  -seednode=<ip>
       Connect to a node to retrieve peer addresses, and disconnect. This
       option can be specified multiple times to connect to multiple
       nodes. During startup, seednodes will be tried before dnsseeds.

  -timeout=<n>
       Specify socket connection timeout in milliseconds. If an initial attempt
       to connect is unsuccessful after this amount of time, drop it
       (minimum: 1, default: 5000)

  -torcontrol=<ip>:<port>
       Tor control host and port to use if onion listening enabled (default:
       127.0.0.1:9051). If no port is specified, the default port of
       9051 will be used.

  -torpassword=<pass>
       Tor control port password (default: empty)

  -v2transport
       Support v2 transport (default: 1)

  -whitebind=<[permissions@]addr>
       Bind to the given address and add permission flags to the peers
       connecting to it. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6. Allowed
       permissions: bloomfilter (allow requesting BIP37 filtered blocks
       and transactions), noban (do not ban for misbehavior; implies
       download), forcerelay (relay transactions that are already in the
       mempool; implies relay), relay (relay even in -blocksonly mode,
       and unlimited transaction announcements), mempool (allow
       requesting BIP35 mempool contents), download (allow getheaders
       during IBD, no disconnect after maxuploadtarget limit), addr
       (responses to GETADDR avoid hitting the cache and contain random
       records with the most up-to-date info). Specify multiple
       permissions separated by commas (default:
       download,noban,mempool,relay). Can be specified multiple times.

  -whitelist=<[permissions@]IP address or network>
       Add permission flags to the peers using the given IP address (e.g.
       1.2.3.4) or CIDR-notated network (e.g. 1.2.3.0/24). Uses the same
       permissions as -whitebind. Additional flags "in" and "out"
       control whether permissions apply to incoming connections and/or
       manual (default: incoming only). Can be specified multiple times.

Wallet options:

  -addresstype
       What type of addresses to use ("legacy", "p2sh-segwit", "bech32",
       "bech32m", default: "bech32")

  -avoidpartialspends
       Group outputs by address, selecting many (possibly all) or none, instead
       of selecting on a per-output basis. Privacy is improved as
       addresses are mostly swept with fewer transactions and outputs
       are aggregated in clean change addresses. It may result in higher
       fees due to less optimal coin selection caused by this added
       limitation and possibly a larger-than-necessary number of inputs
       being used. Always enabled for wallets with "avoid_reuse"
       enabled, otherwise default: 0.

  -changetype
       What type of change to use ("legacy", "p2sh-segwit", "bech32",
       "bech32m"). Default is "legacy" when -addresstype=legacy, else it
       is an implementation detail.

  -consolidatefeerate=<amt>
       The maximum feerate (in BTC/kvB) at which transaction building may use
       more inputs than strictly necessary so that the wallet's UTXO
       pool can be reduced (default: 0.0001).

  -disablewallet
       Do not load the wallet and disable wallet RPC calls

  -discardfee=<amt>
       The fee rate (in BTC/kvB) that indicates your tolerance for discarding
       change by adding it to the fee (default: 0.0001). Note: An output
       is discarded if it is dust at this rate, but we will always
       discard up to the dust relay fee and a discard fee above that is
       limited by the fee estimate for the longest target

  -fallbackfee=<amt>
       A fee rate (in BTC/kvB) that will be used when fee estimation has
       insufficient data. 0 to entirely disable the fallbackfee feature.
       (default: 0.00)

  -keypool=<n>
       Set key pool size to <n> (default: 1000). Warning: Smaller sizes may
       increase the risk of losing funds when restoring from an old
       backup, if none of the addresses in the original keypool have
       been used.

  -maxapsfee=<n>
       Spend up to this amount in additional (absolute) fees (in BTC) if it
       allows the use of partial spend avoidance (default: 0.00)

  -mintxfee=<amt>
       Fee rates (in BTC/kvB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for
       transaction creation (default: 0.00001)

  -paytxfee=<amt>
       (DEPRECATED) Fee rate (in BTC/kvB) to add to transactions you send
       (default: 0.00)

  -signer=<cmd>
       External signing tool, see doc/external-signer.md

  -spendzeroconfchange
       Spend unconfirmed change when sending transactions (default: 1)

  -txconfirmtarget=<n>
       If paytxfee is not set, include enough fee so transactions begin
       confirmation on average within n blocks (default: 6)

  -wallet=<path>
       Specify wallet path to load at startup. Can be used multiple times to
       load multiple wallets. Path is to a directory containing wallet
       data and log files. If the path is not absolute, it is
       interpreted relative to <walletdir>. This only loads existing
       wallets and does not create new ones. For backwards compatibility
       this also accepts names of existing top-level data files in
       <walletdir>.

  -walletbroadcast
       Make the wallet broadcast transactions (default: 1)

  -walletdir=<dir>
       Specify directory to hold wallets (default: <datadir>/wallets if it
       exists, otherwise <datadir>)

  -walletnotify=<cmd>
       Execute command when a wallet transaction changes. %s in cmd is replaced
       by TxID, %w is replaced by wallet name, %b is replaced by the
       hash of the block including the transaction (set to 'unconfirmed'
       if the transaction is not included) and %h is replaced by the
       block height (-1 if not included). %w is not currently
       implemented on windows. On systems where %w is supported, it
       should NOT be quoted because this would break shell escaping used
       to invoke the command.

  -walletrbf
       Send transactions with full-RBF opt-in enabled (RPC only, default: 1)

ZeroMQ notification options:

  -zmqpubhashblock=<address>
       Enable publish hash block in <address>

  -zmqpubhashblockhwm=<n>
       Set publish hash block outbound message high water mark (default: 1000)

  -zmqpubhashtx=<address>
       Enable publish hash transaction in <address>

  -zmqpubhashtxhwm=<n>
       Set publish hash transaction outbound message high water mark (default:
       1000)

  -zmqpubrawblock=<address>
       Enable publish raw block in <address>

  -zmqpubrawblockhwm=<n>
       Set publish raw block outbound message high water mark (default: 1000)

  -zmqpubrawtx=<address>
       Enable publish raw transaction in <address>

  -zmqpubrawtxhwm=<n>
       Set publish raw transaction outbound message high water mark (default:
       1000)

  -zmqpubsequence=<address>
       Enable publish hash block and tx sequence in <address>

  -zmqpubsequencehwm=<n>
       Set publish hash sequence message high water mark (default: 1000)

Debugging/Testing options:

  -debug=<category>
       Output debug and trace logging (default: -nodebug, supplying <category>
       is optional). If <category> is not supplied or if <category> is 1
       or "all", output all debug logging. If <category> is 0 or "none",
       any other categories are ignored. Other valid values for
       <category> are: addrman, bench, blockstorage, cmpctblock, coindb,
       estimatefee, http, i2p, ipc, leveldb, libevent, mempool,
       mempoolrej, net, proxy, prune, qt, rand, reindex, rpc, scan,
       selectcoins, tor, txpackages, txreconciliation, validation,
       walletdb, zmq. This option can be specified multiple times to
       output multiple categories.

  -debugexclude=<category>
       Exclude debug and trace logging for a category. Can be used in
       conjunction with -debug=1 to output debug and trace logging for
       all categories except the specified category. This option can be
       specified multiple times to exclude multiple categories. This
       takes priority over "-debug"

  -help-debug
       Print help message with debugging options and exit

  -logips
       Include IP addresses in debug output (default: 0)

  -loglevelalways
       Always prepend a category and level (default: 0)

  -logsourcelocations
       Prepend debug output with name of the originating source location
       (source file, line number and function name) (default: 0)

  -logthreadnames
       Prepend debug output with name of the originating thread (default: 0)

  -logtimestamps
       Prepend debug output with timestamp (default: 1)

  -maxtxfee=<amt>
       Maximum total fees (in BTC) to use in a single wallet transaction;
       setting this too low may abort large transactions (default: 0.10)

  -printtoconsole
       Send trace/debug info to console (default: 1 when no -daemon. To disable
       logging to file, set -nodebuglogfile)

  -shrinkdebugfile
       Shrink debug.log file on client startup (default: 1 when no -debug)

  -uacomment=<cmt>
       Append comment to the user agent string

Chain selection options:

  -chain=<chain>
       Use the chain <chain> (default: main). Allowed values: main, test,
       testnet4, signet, regtest

  -signet
       Use the signet chain. Equivalent to -chain=signet. Note that the network
       is defined by the -signetchallenge parameter

  -signetchallenge
       Blocks must satisfy the given script to be considered valid (only for
       signet networks; defaults to the global default signet test
       network challenge)

  -signetseednode
       Specify a seed node for the signet network, in the hostname[:port]
       format, e.g. sig.net:1234 (may be used multiple times to specify
       multiple seed nodes; defaults to the global default signet test
       network seed node(s))

  -testnet
       Use the testnet3 chain. Equivalent to -chain=test. Support for testnet3
       is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release.
       Consider moving to testnet4 now by using -testnet4.

  -testnet4
       Use the testnet4 chain. Equivalent to -chain=testnet4.

Node relay options:

  -bytespersigop
       Equivalent bytes per sigop in transactions for relay and mining
       (default: 20)

  -datacarrier
       Relay and mine data carrier transactions (default: 1)

  -datacarriersize
       Relay and mine transactions whose data-carrying raw scriptPubKeys in
       aggregate are of this size or less, allowing multiple outputs
       (default: 100000)

  -minrelaytxfee=<amt>
       Fees (in BTC/kvB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for
       relaying, mining and transaction creation (default: 0.000001)

  -permitbaremultisig
       Relay transactions creating non-P2SH multisig outputs (default: 1)

  -whitelistforcerelay
       Add 'forcerelay' permission to whitelisted peers with default
       permissions. This will relay transactions even if the
       transactions were already in the mempool. (default: 0)

  -whitelistrelay
       Add 'relay' permission to whitelisted peers with default permissions.
       This will accept relayed transactions even when not relaying
       transactions (default: 1)

Block creation options:

  -blockmintxfee=<amt>
       Set lowest fee rate (in BTC/kvB) for transactions to be included in
       block creation. (default: 0.00000001)

  -blockreservedweight=<n>
       Reserve space for the fixed-size block header plus the largest coinbase
       transaction the mining software may add to the block. (default:
       8000).

RPC server options:

  -rest
       Accept public REST requests (default: 0)

  -rpcallowip=<ip>
       Allow JSON-RPC connections from specified source. Valid values for <ip>
       are a single IP (e.g. 1.2.3.4), a network/netmask (e.g.
       1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0), a network/CIDR (e.g. 1.2.3.4/24), all
       ipv4 (0.0.0.0/0), or all ipv6 (::/0). RFC4193 is allowed only if
       -cjdnsreachable=0. This option can be specified multiple times

  -rpcauth=<userpw>
       Username and HMAC-SHA-256 hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The
       field <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>. A
       canonical python script is included in share/rpcauth. The client
       then connects normally using the
       rpcuser=<USERNAME>/rpcpassword=<PASSWORD> pair of arguments. This
       option can be specified multiple times

  -rpcbind=<addr>[:port]
       Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. Do not expose
       the RPC server to untrusted networks such as the public internet!
       This option is ignored unless -rpcallowip is also passed. Port is
       optional and overrides -rpcport. Use [host]:port notation for
       IPv6. This option can be specified multiple times (default:
       127.0.0.1 and ::1 i.e., localhost)

  -rpccookiefile=<loc>
       Location of the auth cookie. Relative paths will be prefixed by a
       net-specific datadir location. (default: data dir)

  -rpccookieperms=<readable-by>
       Set permissions on the RPC auth cookie file so that it is readable by
       [owner|group|all] (default: owner [via umask 0077])

  -rpcpassword=<pw>
       Password for JSON-RPC connections

  -rpcport=<port>
       Listen for JSON-RPC connections on <port> (default: 8332, testnet3:
       18332, testnet4: 48332, signet: 38332, regtest: 18443)

  -rpcthreads=<n>
       Set the number of threads to service RPC calls (default: 16)

  -rpcuser=<user>
       Username for JSON-RPC connections

  -rpcwhitelist=<whitelist>
       Set a whitelist to filter incoming RPC calls for a specific user. The
       field <whitelist> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<rpc 1>,<rpc
       2>,...,<rpc n>. If multiple whitelists are set for a given user,
       they are set-intersected. See -rpcwhitelistdefault documentation
       for information on default whitelist behavior.

  -rpcwhitelistdefault
       Sets default behavior for rpc whitelisting. Unless rpcwhitelistdefault
       is set to 0, if any -rpcwhitelist is set, the rpc server acts as
       if all rpc users are subject to empty-unless-otherwise-specified
       whitelists. If rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 1 and no
       -rpcwhitelist is set, rpc server acts as if all rpc users are
       subject to empty whitelists.

  -server
       Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands
```
