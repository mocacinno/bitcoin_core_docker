### style break

versions v0.2.0 till v0.2.1 are completely different from the other versions (and images).
It seems like these very old versions don't have a headless daemon... You HAVE to run a gui... Which is great fun inside a docker container (sarcasm).  
Because this requirement, i was no longer able to package this version inside a neat, safe, small minimal container, but i had to use a much larger base image instead (so, it has more attack vectors and a bigger size). Because i'm jumping from windows to linux, the wxwidgets gui looks like crap on my pc... I really hope you guys have more luck than i did!!!

What i did to get this stuff running:

```bash
#on my docker host (not inside the container)
xauth list
#i then copied all the magic cookies... each line contains one magic cookie, corresponding to one screen!!!
#i then started my container
docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --network=host --entrypoint /bin/bash -it mocacinno/btc_core:v2.1
#inside my container, i tried each magic cookie combined with each screen... So for example this was one of my tries:
export DISPLAY=localhost:10.0
xauth add myhostname/unix:10 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 randomstring_copied_from_first_step
bitcoin
#then i tried the second magic cookie
export DISPLAY=localhost:11.0
xauth add myhostname/unix:11 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 randomstring_copied_from_first_step
bitcoin
```
