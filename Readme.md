code comes from https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/commit_browser . v0.3.6 and v0.3.3 were clearly indicated in commit messages. This commit lays somewhere between v0.3.3 and v0.3.6... I have no idear if it's v0.3.4, v0.3.5 or some commit somewhere in between...
The general age of the code is more or less correct, but don't blame me if this codebase was not exactly the v0.3.4 tag i gave it!
