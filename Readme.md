# Bitcoin Core Docker Compilation Project

Welcome to the Bitcoin Core Docker compilation project repository! This repository documents the process of compiling all major versions of Bitcoin Core (from v0.2.8 to v27.1) inside a SLES 15 SP6 BCI_minimal container.

This project aims to make older Bitcoin Core versions available for use in specific scenarios like:

- Manipulating old wallets
- Learning and experimenting
- Analyzing feature changes over time
- Resolving community discussions
